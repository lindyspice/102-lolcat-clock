# 102-lolcat-clock

My first Javascript project, for Skillcrush 102. Incorporated skills in
creating a conceptual flowchart with simple logic statements, using
pseudocode to identify variables, and translating into objects, functions,
for loops, and arrays. Final construction added connection to the DOM
via getElementByID(), and user interactions with addEventListener().
